        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 16 year old who likes to program, and do electrical engineering related things.
                I am currently in the process of learning HTML and Unity/Gamedev.
                If you want to learn more about me I recommed my YouTube channel!

        <h2>How I code</h2>
            <p>
                This may not seem that important but if you ever want to play my projects, it most likely is important.
                Most of my engineering skills end up involving electronics. Because of this I have been a fairly slow learner.
                My code ends up using the hardest, but simpliest to code, way of doing it.
