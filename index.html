                <h3>SnekBloks3D</h3>
                    <p>
                        SnekBloks 3D is the 3D version of the SnekBloks game I developed which will one day be avaliable as a web player.

                <h3>VoidHH</h3>
                    <p>
                        VoidHH stands for Void HandHeld. It is an idea I had of a gameboy sytle device that I can use to show or play some of my games without the internet or a larger device.
